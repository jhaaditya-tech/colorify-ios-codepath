### App Idea
I want to build an app called **LeetTrack** that helps users manually track their LeetCode problem-solving progress and analyze their performance over time. The app would include features like:
- **Progress Tracking**: Allow users to manually log solved problems, unsolved problems, and attempts.
- **First/Second Attempt Insights**: Let users record whether a problem was solved on the first attempt or required additional tries.
- **Revision Filter**: Enable users to filter problems they were unable to solve on the first try for targeted revision.
- **Company Tags**: Allow users to manually tag problems with companies that have asked them recently.
- **Problem Notes**: Let users add custom notes for each problem, such as key takeaways or areas for improvement.
- **Performance Analytics**: Generate summaries based on manually entered data, including time spent, problem categories, and weak areas.
- **Friends Progress**: Add friends to the app and see their manually entered progress, including solved problems and revision goals.

The app focuses on simplicity by letting users input data manually, ensuring they can personalize their progress tracking and maintain detailed logs for interview preparation. With the additional feature of tracking friends' progress, users can stay motivated and learn collaboratively.
